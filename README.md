# Typing Automator

A bash script and an apple script that lets you specify a string and a delay, and then have that string typed out at a uniform speed after the delay.

Good for recording demo videos like this (meta) one.

 cd typing-automator
 chmod +x type_demo.sh

 (adjust the last number as needed to give you enough time to switch to the window where you want the text to appear.
